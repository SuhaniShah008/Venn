# Java Set Duplicate Finder (Venn Diagram Concept)

This is a simple **Java** program that uses `HashSet` to compare two sets of elements and identify **duplicates (intersections)**. It represents the foundational logic behind a **Venn diagram**, focusing on set operations.

## What It Does

- Takes two sets of items (e.g., strings or integers)
- Uses `HashSet` to:
  - Store unique elements in each set
  - Find common elements using intersection
- Prints:
  - Items unique to each set
  - Items that appear in both sets
